% The Belvedere Glacier (Randolph Glacier Inventory code RGI60--11.02858) is an alpine
% glacier in Valle Anzasca (Italy), on the east side of the Monte Rosa Massif (N
% \ang{45;58} E \ang{7;55}) (\figref{fig:studyarea}). 
% The lower part of the Belvedere Glacier is a temperate debris-covered glacier, that covers an area of
% \SI{\sim1.8}{\kilo\meter\squared} and extends from an altitude of \SI{\sim2250}{\masl} to \SI{\sim1800}{\masl}.
% This region is characterized by a gentle slope, and it is fed by ice falls and snow
% avalanches coming from the Monte Rosa East Face \citep{Haeberli2002}. In its low-relief
% sector, the Belvedere Glacier splits into two lobes, reaching \SI{\sim1800}{\masl}.
% The northern lobe, in particular, ends with a prominent ice cliff, from which the River
% Anza springs.

% Similarly to Miage glacier (Monte Bianco, Valle dâ€™Aosta), the Belvedere Glacier is almost completely covered by rocks and boulders with dimensions ranging from few decimetres to some meters, which makes it a \textit{black glaciers}.
% Due to the global warming trend, the~number of black glaciers along the Italian Alps is rising~\citep{Diolaiuti2003}. 
% Up to the beginning of the century, the~debris cover helped to compensate the effect of the increased temperature, establishing a negative feedback in the temperature-ablation relationship~\citep{Roethlisberger1985,Diolaiuti2003}.
% However, in~recent years, the~debris cover protection has not been sufficient to limit the glacier~retreat.

% In the past, several hazardous events originated by the Belvedere Glacier, such as floods
% and slope instability, threatened the nearby village of Macugnaga and the Zamboni Zappa Hut,
% at 2070 m a.s.l. \citep{Kaab2004}. 
% At the beginning of the 21st century, the Belvedere Glacier was characterized by a particular 
% surge-type dynamics  \citep{Haeberli2002}. 
% During the late 1990s, the~surface speeds of the whole glacier were ranging between \SIlist{30;45}{\meter\per\year}~\cite{Roethlisberger1985, Kaab2005}.
% During 2000--2001 an accelerated flow in the Monte-Rosa Glacier produced a wave of compression-decompression stresses and strains in the Belvedere Glacier. 
% Surface velocities soared: values up to \SI{200}{\meter\per\year} were observed photogrammetrically during autumn 2001~\cite{Kaab2004}. 
% The ice thickness increased more than~\SI{20}{\meter} and the wave travelled downwards, creating a depression area in the accumulation zone, that was filled by a super-glacial lake, the~Lago Effimero~\cite{Haeberli2002, Mortara2009}.

% The northern lobe of the Belvedere Glacier is concurrently experiencing a fast retreat:
% in the past few years, an average retreat of \SI{\sim20}{\meter\per\year} was documented
% \citep{Ioli2022} and it is actively changing every day, due to ice falls and collapses.
