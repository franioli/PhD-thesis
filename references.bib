In particular, we investigate multispectral generalisations of two popular interest point detectors (Harris and difference of Gaussians), and show that these give a marked improvement in performance when the extra NIR channel is available. We also look at the problem of multimodal RGB to NIR registration, and propose a variant of the SIFT descriptor that gives improved performance.},
