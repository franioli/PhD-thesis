\section{Motivation and relevance}

Glaciers all over the world are experiencing profound transformations due to the ongoing climate crisis~\citep{Oerlemans2005} and their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations renders them powerful indicators of global climate change~\citep{Barry2006}.
Alpine glaciers, situated in temperate zones, are particularly susceptible to rising temperatures. The accelerated rate of glacial retreat underscores the necessity for comprehensive monitoring programs~\citep{Zemp2006,Sommer2020}. 
Therefore, they are often considered as a proxy for climate change evaluation.
Projections point out that the European Alps may lose more than 60\% of ice volume by the end of the century under the RCP2.6 scenario, whereas a larger amount of ice loss is expected under worse scenarios~\citep{Zekollari2019}.

However, mountain glaciers are a critical component of the local economy regarding freshwater supply, hydroelectric production, and tourist activities.
In particular, glaciers serve as critical as crucial freshwater reservoirs and their undergoing transformation is likely to have severe consequences for the future water availability~\citep{Barnett2005, hock2005}. 
Additionally, glacier melting and retreat are triggering several glaciological processes, e.g., ice break-off, glacier outburst, snow/ice avalanches, and gravitational slope stability processes, such as rockfalls and collapses, and debris flow, which can threaten the population, urban areas or infrastructure of the nearby areas~\citep{Kaab2004, Deline2015, Giordan2020}.
In the European Alps, the number of mass movements and hazardous events in high-elevation environments has experienced an increase in the past decade due to climate change~\citep{chiarle2023, Nigrelli2024}.

A relevant and tragic example was the collapse of a section of the Marmolada Glacier 
(Dolomites, Italy), which occurred on 3 July 2022 at 13:43:20 CEST\footnote{\url{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/03/deaths-glacier-breaks-marmolada-mountain-italy}}. 
The collapse caused an ice avalanche that killed 11 mountaineers trying to reach the Marmolada summit and injured 7~\citep{Olivieri2023, Bondesan2023}.
The collapse occurred on the northern slope of the glacier at an elevation of \SI{3213}{\masl} and involved a volume of \SI{\sim 96000}{\cubic\meter}~\citep{Olivieri2023}.
The detachment was caused by a failure along a median crevasse, partially filled by meltwater due to highly anomalous temperatures, that reached \SI{10.7}{\degree\celsius} at the time of the event.
The sudden glacier collapse was probably induced by a combination of hydraulic jacking and pressure within a thin layer of basal till~\citep{Bondesan2023}.

Just one year after the Marmolada collapse, another relevant event slope instability event was registered in the Austrian state of Tyrol, close to the Italian border. 
On 11 June 2023, a big portion of the summit of Fluchthorn, a nearly \SI{3400}{\masl} has collapsed sending more than \SI{100000}{\cubic\meter} of rock crashing into the valley below and triggering mudslides\footnote{\mbox{\url{https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/14/europe/austrian-mountain-fluchthorn-rockslide-climate-intl/index.html}}}.
This event was likely related to the thawing permafrost due to the high temperatures of that period\footnote{\url{https://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/2023/06/12/fluchthorn-1/}}.

\end{figure}

On 27 August 2023, a large debris flow occurred at the Belvedere Glacier (Anzasca Valley, Italian Alps)\footnote{\url{https://www.regione.piemonte.it/web/temi/protezione-civile-difesa-suolo-opere-pubbliche/protezione-civile/sorvolo-ghiacciai-monte-rosa-07092023}}.
The debris flow was triggered at the beginning of the steep Castelfranco gully, located at approximately \SI{3600}{\masl} on the streamwise-left side of the Belvedere Glacier north-west lobe (\figref{fig:1:belvedere_debris_flow}).
During the event, a volume of \SI{\sim 200000}{\cubic\meter} was accumulated on top of the Belvedere Glacier and obstructed the sinkhole that allowed the Castelfranco stream to flow below the ice sheet. 
This caused the water to stream on top of the glacier, carving deep grooves on top of the Belvedere Glacier (\figref{fig:1:belvedere_debris_flow:cam}). 
A large portion of the debris was transported towards the valley and the municipality of Macugnaga by the river Anza and cumulated in the riverbed.
A previous event with similar characteristics but significantly smaller dimensions occurred in 2008 and was documented by \cite{Mortara2009}, who reported an estimation of the cumulated debris volume.

In this context, a systematic monitoring of glaciers and related glaciological processes assumes a crucial significance.
To achieve a thorough understanding of these complex systems, accurate observations are essential \citep{Kaab2005}.
A particular focus is usually placed on monitoring surface kinematics, as these can potentially offer early warning signs of impending instability or collapse events \citep{Faillettaz2015}.
Nevertheless, monitoring glaciers in remote areas and inaccessible terrains often presents logistical and safety challenges.
Therefore, remote sensing techniques are widely used as they allow for observing glacial processes with minimal risk for scientists and technicians. 

\section{Remote and close-range sensing of alpine environments}

Remote sensing techniques have revolutionized our ability to study and monitor the dynamic landscapes of mountain environments. 
These techniques offer diverse ways to capture land surface characteristics from remote, providing insights into glacial processes and other natural phenomena in these often inaccessible regions.

Satellite-based remote sensing has played a central role in glacier monitoring for the past several decades \citep{Paul2007}. 
From mapping glacier outlines from optical imagery or combinations of different bands~\citep{Hall1995, Paul_2002, Winsvold2016} to deriving planimetric displacements using Digital Image Correlation (DIC)~\citep{Scambos1992, Kaab2005, Scherler2008, altena_kaab_2020}, satellites provide a wide-scale view of glacier evolution. 
Additionally, remote sensing enables mass balance estimation \citep{Bamber2007, Berthier2016, Rabatel2017, Berthier2023}.
However, despite satellite remote sensing being essential for regional- or even global-scale glacier monitoring, the freely available satellite solutions lack the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to monitor small alpine glaciers and their rapid changes.

For glacier monitoring, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers advantages such as the ability to penetrate clouds and acquire data regardless of illumination conditions \citep{Fang2016, Winsvold2018, Strozzi2020}. 
Techniques like InSAR can detect small movement in the presence of permanent scatter-like features on the glacier \citep{schubert2013glacier}, but challenges arise with significant surface changes due to the long satellite revisiting periods that can lead to a loss of coherence between two consecutive images.
Furthermore, offset tracking on SAR amplitude images \citep{schellenberger2015sar}, while useful for mapping planimetric velocity, frequently suffers from the coarse resolution of free SAR satellite imagery.

Recent advances in Very High-Resolution Satellites (VHR) satellites such as World-View, Spot, Pleiades and Pleiades Neo enable meter or sub-meter resolution DSM generation from stereo pairs or triplets \citep{rupnik2018_VHR, Perko218, Tonolo2020}.
These satellites offer unprecedented spatial detail for glacier monitoring, yet limitations exist.
High commercial costs and the lack of long historical image series compared to Landsat or Sentinel-2 restrict their applications at wider temporal scales.

Aerial or helicopter-based photogrammetry fills the critical niche between satellite-based and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) -based approaches, offering the potential for decimeter-level 3D reconstructions over remote mountain areas \citep{poli2020use}. 
While the cost of photogrammetric flights remains a factor, the availability of regional mapping datasets presents a unique opportunity for long-term glacier monitoring. Historical aerial imagery allows us to reconstruct glacier geometries far into the past \citep{Degaetani2021}, extending our understanding beyond the era of VHR satellites and offering valuable insights into the evolution of small alpine glaciers.

In the past decade, UAVs have emerged as powerful and cost-effective tools for small to mid-scale mapping.
In conjunction with advances in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) \citep{Westoby2012} and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) \citep{Seitz2006} algorithms,  UAVs enable the generation of high-resolution 3D point clouds, DSMs, and orthophotos for glacier studies. 
Their ease of deployment, minimal requirements, and ability to access remote areas safely make them invaluable in glacial environments \citep{immerzeel2014, Chudley2019, ioli2021mid}. 

Several examples of UAV and photogrammetry applications for cryosphere monitoring can be found in the literature~\citep{Bhardwaj2016, Gaffey2020}.
These studies cover diverse environments and methodological approaches.
For instance, \cite{Whitehead2013} employed fixed-wing UAVs and piloted helicopters with low-cost cameras to generate orthophotos and DSMs of the Fountain Glacier in the Canadian Arctic, demonstrating the applicability of UAVs for glacier mapping even in challenging conditions. 
Similarly, \cite{immerzeel2014} and \cite{kraaijenbrink2016} used fixed-wing UAVs to evaluate seasonal surface velocities of the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in Nepal, highlighting the potential for analyzing glacier dynamics at fine temporal scales.
\cite{Gindraux2017} further investigated the impact of Ground Control Point (GCP) quantity and distribution on the accuracy of UAV-derived glacier DSMs and she proposed a technique based on the joint usage of DIC on both DSMs and orthophotos to derive glacier kinematics.
The growing body of recent work \citep{Benoit2019, Chudley2019, Jouvet2020, Cao2021, Lamsters2022, belloni2023} showcases the widespread adoption of UAVs and low-cost photogrammetry in glacier monitoring. 
These studies demonstrate their effectiveness in capturing high spatial resolution data while minimizing the need for extensive and potentially hazardous in-situ operations. Moreover, studies like \cite{ioli2021mid} prove the feasibility of using UAVs for mid-term (i.e., ten-year span) glacier monitoring with both very high spatial resolution and annual temporal frequency. 
This underscores the potential of UAVs to track glacier evolution at unprecedented levels of detail over extended periods \citep{ioli2021mid, belloni2023}.
However, continuous in-situ monitoring with sub-seasonal temporal frequency using UAVs can be logistically challenging.

While UAV photogrammetry excels in spatial resolution, reconstruction accuracy, and flexibility, capturing short-term glacier dynamics at a high temporal frequency necessitates permanent in-situ monitoring systems. 
Short-term observations (e.g., daily) are crucial for achieving a deep understanding of these rapidly evolving glaciers and their associated processes, particularly concerning external forces like air temperature. 
Low-cost time-lapse camera systems are particularly valuable in this regard. 
They offer daily observations for studying sub-seasonal glacier kinematics and responses to external factors within a warming climate.  
Neither satellite-based nor aerial/UAV photogrammetric techniques can provide this level of continuous data due to their revisit time limitations.

Terrestrial SAR and TLS have gained attention for short-term monitoring. 
SAR's all-weather, day-and-night capabilities are ideal for real-time monitoring and early warning systems \cite{Noferini2009, Dematteis2021}. 
However, the high costs, complex logistics, and often site-specific focus of ground-based SAR and permanent TLS limit their widespread application for regional-scale monitoring.
Fixed time-lapse cameras present a cost-effective alternative for gathering both qualitative and quantitative data on glacier dynamics~\citep{Giordan2016, James2016, Maas2006, Messerli2015}.

Monitoring glacier surface kinematics is especially important, as it can provide early indications of impending instability \citep{Faillettaz2015}.
A powerful approach for deriving glacier flow velocity using close-range or remote sensing involves DIC or feature tracking algorithms~\citep{ahn_box_2010, Giordan2016, Hadhri2019}.
At its core, DIC works by tracking distinctive pixel patterns across a time series of images.
It begins by dividing the reference image into small subsets, known as templates or interrogation windows. 
For each template, DIC uses cross-correlation techniques to identify the most similar region within a designated search area in the subsequent image.
This can be done either in the spatial domain \citep{Scambos1992} or frequency domain \citep{rolstad1997}.
The displacement between the template’s original position and this matching region represents the movement of the tracked feature on the glacier's surface.
Initially applied to glaciers by \cite{Scambos1992}, DIC is now widely used for analyzing glacier movement using various remote sensing data sources.
This includes optical satellite imagery \citep{Scambos1992, Scherler2008, Heid2012_evaluation_xcorr} as well as high-resolution orthophotos derived from aerial or UAV photogrammetry \citep{immerzeel2014, Chudley2019, ioli2021mid}.

While monoscopic time-lapse cameras effectively derive surface kinematics using DIC, a richer 3D reconstruction demands a multi-camera setup. 
However, the constraints of mountainous terrain can force camera placement into less-than-ideal positions. 
This often results in challenging acquisition geometries, such as very long baselines or strongly convergent angles \citep{ioli2024deep}.
Traditional image matching techniques, that rely on handcrafted feature descriptors (e.g., SIFT, Kaze, ORB), struggle with the substantial variations introduced by these geometries.  Perspective shifts, occlusions, and the difficulty of reliably matching features across dramatically different views impede accurate 3D reconstruction. 
These limitations call for innovative approaches to ensure robust feature matching and scene reconstruction in these complex environments.
Deep learning (DL), particularly attention-based architectures, has emerged as a powerful solution. 
DL-based matching techniques surpass traditional methods in their adaptability to wide baselines, significant radiometric differences, and complex geometric distortions. 
Research in this domain has progressed rapidly, with models specifically designed to handle oblique images, historical image sets, and even low-quality consumer cameras.

\section{Objectives}

This thesis presents an integrated approach to monitoring an alpine glacier across multiple spatial and temporal scales, using photogrammetric and image-based techniques. 
The study focuses specifically on the debris-covered Belvedere Glacier in the Italian Alps.

The work begins by examining major geomorphological changes over decades at the meter scale to establish a broad temporal and spatial context, and then it moves to a finer scale, focusing on changes at the centimeter scale with daily observations to capture the short-term dynamics of this rapidly evolving environment.

\textcolor{red}{Add figure of multi-temporal/multi-scale}

To investigate the long-term evolution of the glacier, this study uses archival aerial photogrammetry data collected by public agencies during mapping flights.
This technique allowed the reconstruction of past glacier morphology from 1977 to 2009, with approximately decadal intervals between models.  
The historical knowledge gained through this method is invaluable in documenting a natural heritage that is rapidly disappearing due to climate change. 
Of particular interest, archival photogrammetry reveals a significant period of glacier expansion in the early of the glacier in the early 21st century, allowing precise quantification of the increase in ice volume and glacier thickness.

To understand the current evolution of the glacier, this work integrates low-cost UAVs and GNSS for close-range photogrammetric monitoring.
Annual in-situ surveys, conducted since 2015, provide a periodical and highly accurate record of the evolution. 
Through these UAV surveys, centimeter-scale resolution enables detailed mapping of the dynamic environment, including precise quantification of glacier volume loss and study of variations in glacier flow rate.

However, alpine glacier dynamics are inherently non-linear, with a pronounced acceleration of processes in summer compared to winter.  
This trend has intensified in recent years due to the increasing frequency of hot and dry summers associated with climate change. 
While annual high-precision in-situ measurements provide essential insights into long-term geomorphological evolution, they lack the temporal resolution to fully capture the short-term kinematics of the glacier, which are crucial for
understanding the relationship between glacier dynamics and external drivers such as air temperature.
To address this need, a permanent monitoring system based on low-cost stereo cameras has been designed and installed on Belvedere Glacier. 
This system allows daily observations of glacier motion at a local spatial scale,
providing the high-frequency data needed for in-depth kinematic analysis.

This thesis describes the technical design and implementation of a low-cost glacier monitoring system, as well as the development of novel software tools for extracting relevant information from stereo camera images via photogrammetric processing. 
To overcome the limitations of existing software in handling images with extremely wide baselines, a new pipeline was designed and published. 
This pipeline allows the analysis of time-series point clouds and the extraction of metrics such as velocity, volume variations, and displacement.

A major challenge was related to the challenging mountain environment, which constrained the camera placement.
This resulted in extremely wide baselines and significant viewpoint differences.  
These conditions made it difficult to find corresponding points using traditional local feature-matching techniques and hindered 3D reconstruction using existing commercial and open-source photogrammetric software.
To overcome this obstacle, a novel pipeline was developed using state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms for robust feature matching that successfully overcomes the limitations of wide baseline stereo image processing.

This thesis presents a successful pilot test of the low-cost glacier monitoring system.
The current uses only two cameras installed at the northwest terminal lobe of the Belvedere glacier, focused on the terminal ice cliff, which is the portion of the glacier that is experiencing the most severe retreat and fast evolution. 
To achieve a more comprehensive and robust monitoring framework capable of capturing the full dynamics of the glacier, the system needs to be scaled up. 
Expanding the camera network will increase the coverage and significantly improve the quality of the daily 3D reconstructions through greater data redundancy.
Motivated by this potential, the final part of this thesis focuses on the development of a flexible multi-view library. 
This library enables image matching using both state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and traditional hand-crafted features. 
Crucially, it integrates seamlessly with existing photogrammetric software for streamlined 3D reconstruction, thus supporting a future expansion of the monitoring system.

This thesis explores the potential of multi-scale and multi-temporal photogrammetry for alpine glacier monitoring.  
The research will encompass a range of photogrammetric techniques, spanning historical aerial imagery for long-term analysis, modern UAV acquisitions for annual accurate reconstruction of the glacier morphology, to permanent in-situ monitoring techniques based on low-cost stereo cameras for daily kinematics analysis.

\section{The Belvedere Glacier}\label{sec:1:belvedereglacier}

The Belvedere Glacier (Randolph Glacier Inventory code RGI60--11.02858) is an alpine
glacier in the Anzasca Valley (Italy), on the east side of the Monte Rosa Massif (N
\ang{45;58} E \ang{7;55}) (\figref{fig:1:studyarea}).
The lower part of the Belvedere Glacier is a temperate debris-covered glacier, that
covers an area of \SI{\sim1.8}{\kilo\meter\squared} and extends from an altitude of \SI{\sim2250}{\masl} to \SI{\sim1800}{\masl}.
This region is characterized by a gentle slope, and it is fed by icefalls and snow
avalanches coming from the Monte Rosa East Face \citep{Haeberli2002}. 
In its low-relief sector, the Belvedere Glacier splits into two lobes, reaching \SI{\sim1800}{\masl}.
The northern lobe, in particular, ends with a prominent ice cliff, from which the River
Anza springs.

Similarly to Miage Glacier (Monte Bianco, Valle d’Aosta), the Belvedere Glacier is almost
completely covered by rocks and boulders with dimensions ranging from a few decimetres to
some meters, which makes it a \textit{black glaciers}.
Due to the global warming trend, the number of black glaciers along the Italian Alps is
rising~\citep{Diolaiuti2003}.
\marginpar[Note 1]{
    \includegraphics[width=\marginparwidth]{qr_thebelvedereglacier.png}
    % \footnote{\url{www.thebelvedereglacier.it}}
}
Up to the beginning of the century, the~debris cover helped to compensate the effect of
the increased temperature, establishing a negative feedback in the temperature-ablation
relationship~\citep{Roethlisberger1985,Diolaiuti2003}.
However, in recent years, the debris cover protection has not been sufficient to limit
the glacier~retreat.

In the past, several hazardous events originated from the Belvedere Glacier, such as floods
and slope instability, threatened the nearby village of Macugnaga and the Zamboni Zappa
Hut, at 2070 m a.s.l. \citep{Kaab2004}.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the Belvedere Glacier was characterized by a
particular surge-type dynamics  \citep{Haeberli2002}.
During the late 1990s, the~surface speeds of the whole glacier were ranging between
\SIlist{30;45}{\meter\per\year}~\citep{Roethlisberger1985, Kaab2005}.
During 2000--2001 an accelerated flow in the Monte-Rosa Glacier produced a wave of
compression-decompression stresses and strains in the Belvedere Glacier.
Surface velocities soared: values up to \SI{200}{\meter\per\year} were observed
photogrammetrically during autumn 2001~\citep{Kaab2004}.
The ice thickness increased more than~\SI{20}{\meter} and the wave travelled downwards,
creating a depression area in the accumulation zone, that was filled by a super-glacial
lake, the Lago Effimero~\citep{Haeberli2002, Mortara2009}.

During spring 2002, the large depression at the foot of the Monte Rosa east face, caused by the 
surge-type movement was temporarily filled by a lake with a volume of \SI{3e6}{\cubic\meter}, 
the socalled \textit{Lago Effimero} (\textit{short-lived lake}).
Recognizing the potential danger of an outburst flood, the Italian Civil Defense Department rapidly 
implemented emergency measures, including evacuating parts of Macugnaga village, installing automatic 
alarm systems and pumps, and initiating detailed scientific investigations. 
Reduced meltwater input in July 2002, combined with natural subglacial drainage, stabilized and subsequently 
lowered the lake level.
However, the lake reformed in the spring of 2003 and it burst out in mid-June of that year without causing 
any significant damage \citep{Kaab2004}.
