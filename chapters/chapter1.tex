\section{Motivation and relevance}

Glaciers all over the world are experiencing profound transformations due to the ongoing climate crisis~\citep{Oerlemans2005} and their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations renders them powerful indicators of global climate change~\citep{Barry2006}.
Alpine glaciers, situated in temperate zones, are particularly susceptible to rising temperatures. The accelerated rate of glacial retreat underscores the necessity for comprehensive monitoring programs~\citep{Zemp2006,Sommer2020}. 
Therefore, they are often considered as a proxy for climate change evaluation.
Projections point out that the European Alps may lose more than 60\% of ice volume by the end of the century under the RCP2.6 scenario, whereas a larger amount of ice loss is expected under worse scenarios~\citep{Zekollari2019}.

However, mountain glaciers are a critical component of the local economy regarding freshwater supply, hydroelectric production, and tourist activities.
In particular, glaciers serve as critical as crucial freshwater reservoirs and their undergoing transformation is likely to have severe consequences for the future water availability~\citep{Barnett2005, hock2005}. 
Additionally, glacier melting and retreat are triggering several glaciological processes, e.g., ice break-off, glacier outburst, snow/ice avalanches, and gravitational slope stability processes, such as rockfalls and collapses, and debris flow, which can threaten the population, urban areas or infrastructure of the nearby areas~\citep{Kaab2004, Deline2015, Giordan2020}.
In the European Alps, the number of mass movements and hazardous events in high-elevations environments has experienced an increase in the past decade due to climate change~\citep{chiarle2023, Nigrelli2024}.

A relevant and tragic example was the collapse of a section of the Marmolada Glacier 
\marginpar[Note 1]{
    \includegraphics[width=\marginparwidth]{dummy_qr}
    \textcolor{red}{test for a lateral note for qr code}
}
(Dolomites, Italy), which occurred on 3 July 2022 at 13:43:20 CEST\footnote{\url{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/03/deaths-glacier-breaks-marmolada-mountain-italy}}. 
The collapse caused an ice avalanche that killed 11 mountaineers trying to reach the Marmolada summit and injured 7~\citep{Olivieri2023, Bondesan2023}.
The collapse occurred on the northern slope of the glacier at an elevation of \SI{3213}{\masl} and involved a volume of \SI{\sim 96000}{\cubic\meter}~\citep{Olivieri2023}.
The detachment was caused by a failure along a median crevasse, partially filled by meltwater due to highly anomalous temperatures, that reached \SI{10.7}{\degree\celsius} at the time of the event.
The sudden glacier collapse was probably induced by a combination of hydraulic jacking and pressure within a thin layer of basal till~\citep{Bondesan2023}.

Just one year after the Marmolada collapse, another relevant event slope instability event was registered in the Austrian state of Tyrol, close to the Italian border. 
On 11 June 2023, a big portion of the summit of Fluchthorn, a nearly \SI{3400}{\masl} has collapsed sending more than \SI{100000}{\cubic\meter} of rock crashing into the valley below and triggering mudslides\footnote{\mbox{\url{https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/14/europe/austrian-mountain-fluchthorn-rockslide-climate-intl/index.html}}}.
This event was likely related to the thawing permafrost due to the high temperatures of that period\footnote{\url{https://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/2023/06/12/fluchthorn-1/}}.

On 30 August 2023, a large debris flow occurred at the Belvedere Glacier
\marginpar[Note 1]{
    \includegraphics[width=\marginparwidth]{dummy_qr}
    \textcolor{red}{test for a lateral note for qr code}
}
(Anzasca Valley, Italian Alps)\footnote{\url{https://www.regione.piemonte.it/web/temi/protezione-civile-difesa-suolo-opere-pubbliche/protezione-civile/sorvolo-ghiacciai-monte-rosa-07092023}}.
The debris flow was triggered at the beginning of the steep Castelfranco gully, located at approximately \SI{3600}{\masl} on the streamwise-left side of the Belvedere Glacier north-west lobe.
During the event, a volume of \SI{\sim 200000}{\cubic\meter} was accumulated on top of the Belvedere Glacier and obstructed the sinkhole that allowed the Castelfranco stream to flow below the ice sheet. 
This caused the water to stream on top of the glacier, carving deep grooves on top of the Belvedere Glacier. 
A large portion of the debris was transported towards the valley and the municipality of Macugnaga by the river Anza and cumulated in the riverbed.
A previous event with similar characteristics but significantly smaller dimensions occurred in 2008 and was documented by \cite{Mortara2009}, who reported an estimation of the cumulated debris volume of a few thousand cubic meters.

In this context, long-term monitoring of glaciers and related glaciological processes assumes a crucial significance.
To achieve a thorough understanding of these complex systems, systematic observations are essential~\citep{Kaab2005}.
A particular focus is usually placed on monitoring surface kinematics, as these can potentially offer early warning signs of impending instability or collapse events~\citep{Faillettaz2015}.
Nevertheless, monitoring glaciers in remote areas and inaccessible terrains often presents logistical and safety challenges.
Therefore, remote sensing techniques are widely used as they allow for observing glacial processes with minimal risk for scientists and technicians. 

\section{Remote and close-range sensing of alpine environments}

In the past 30 years, the availability of free and commercial satellite imagery, with various spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions, has widely enlarged the possibility of sensing remote areas.
The literature for satellite-based global or regional mapping of glaciers is nowadays extremely wide and covers different aspects of glacier monitoring \citep{Paul2007}. 
This includes glacier outline mapping from optical imagery (\textcolor{red}{REF}) or from combinations of different bands~\citep{Winsvold2016}, such as Red and SWIR bands or the near-infrared and SWIR (short-wave infrared band)~\citep{Paul_2002} or the normalized difference snow index (NDSI)~\citep{Hall1995}.
Planimetric glacier displacements and flow velocity are often derived from ortho-projected products with digital image correlation (DIC) techniques~\citep{Scambos1992, Kaab2005, Scherler2008, altena_kaab_2020}. 
Satellite remote sensing has been used also for estimating mass balances~\citep{Bamber2007, Berthier2016, Rabatel2017, Berthier2023}.
\textcolor{red}{(SAR and passive satellites?)}
% \textcolor{red}{Satellite SAR data \citep{Strozzi2020, Fang2016, Winsvold2018}.}

Although satellite remote sensing is essential for large-scale regional or even global glacier monitoring, most of the free solutions offer limited spatial and temporal resolution, which hinders the ability to sense small alpine glaciers and capture short-term glacier dynamics.

In the past decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have undergone rapid technological advancements and cost reductions,
making them indispensable tools for environmental monitoring. 
Coupled with modern Structure-from-Motion (SfM) \citep{Westoby2012} and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) \citep{Seitz2006} algorithms, 
images captured by UAV-mounted cameras enable the creation of high-resolution 3D point clouds, Digital Surface Models (DSMs),
and orthophotos. 
Their applications in environmental studies are extensive, including geomorphology modelling~\citep{Cook2017, James2017_3duncertainty}, 
river flow velocity and discharge estimation~\citep{Detert2017,Ioli2020}, 
snow volume calculation~\citep{DeMichele2016, Buhler2016, Avanzi2018},
dam sediment volume evaluation~\citep{Pagliari2016}, glaciers \citep{Immerzeel2014, Chudley2019, Groos2019}, 
periglacial morphology \citep{Sledz2021}.

Several examples of UAV and photogrammetry applications for cryosphere monitoring can be found in the literature~\citep{Bhardwaj2016, Gaffey2020}.
For instance, \cite{Whitehead2013} employed fixed-wing and helicopter-based UAVs equipped with low-cost cameras to generate orthophotos 
and DSMs of the Fountain Glacier in the Canadian Arctic. 
Similarly,~\cite{Immerzeel2014} and \cite{kraaijenbrink2016} leveraged fixed-wing UAVs for evaluating seasonal surface velocities of the debris-covered
Lirung Glacier in Nepal. 
\cite{Gindraux2017} further investigated the impact of Ground Control Point (GCP) quantity and distribution on the accuracy of UAV-derived glacier DSMs 
and she proposed a technique based on the joint usage of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) on both DSMs and orthophotos to derive glacier kinematics.
The growing body of recent work highlights the potential of UAVs and low-cost photogrammetry to efficiently monitor small and mid-scale 
glaciers with high spatial resolution, as they enable comprehensive reconstruction of glacier morphology while minimizing in-situ operations and
costs \citep{Benoit2019, Chudley2019, Jouvet2020, Cao2021, Lamsters2022, belloni2023}.
Moreover, studies like \cite{ioli2021mid} demonstrate the feasibility of using UAVs for mid-term (i.e., ten-year span) glacier monitoring with 
very high spatial resolution and annual temporal frequency.
 
\textcolor{red}{... Part on in-situ monitoring for high spatial res and frequency...}
While UAVs vastly improve spatial resolution, they might not fully replace in-situ monitoring for tasks requiring high temporal frequency 
(e.g., continuous measurements)....

% Fixed time-lapse cameras offer an affordable alternative to terrestrial SAR and TLS for

% dynamics~\citep{Giordan2016,James2016, Maas2006,Messerli2015}.

% \citep{ahn_box_2010,Giordan2016,Hadhri2019,James2016,Messerli2015}.
% However, external Digital Surface Models (DSMs) are required to convert 2D pixel
% displacements obtained by DIC into 3D displacement vectors.

% \cite{Paul2015, KaabFunk1999}

A powerful approach for deriving glacier flow velocity using remote sensing involves DIC or 
feature tracking algorithms~\citep{ahn_box_2010, Giordan2016, Hadhri2019}.
At its core, DIC tracks distinct pixel patterns across a time series of images, employing cross-correlation to quantify 
surface displacements. 
This implies iteratively analyzing subsets of the reference image (often referred to as \textit{templates} 
or \textit{windows}), pinpointing the location of maximum similarity within a search area in the subsequent 
image by cross-correlation in spatial \citep{Scambos1992} or frequency domain \citep{rolstad1997}.
This shift represents the displacement of the tracked feature.
Initially applied to glaciers by \cite{Scambos1992}, DIC is now widely used to analyze optical satellite imagery
\citep{Scambos1992, Scherler2008, Heid2012_evaluation_xcorr} or high-resolution orthophotos derived by aerial or 
UAV photogrammetry \citep{Immerzeel2014, Chudley2019, ioli2021mid}.


\section{Objectives}

This thesis presents an integrated approach to monitoring an alpine glacier across multiple 
spatial and temporal scales, using photogrammetric and image-based techniques. 
The study focuses specifically on the debris-covered Belvedere Glacier in the Italian Alps.

The work begins by examining major geomorphological changes over decades at the meter scale to
establish a broad temporal and spatial context, and then it moves to a finer scale, 
focusing on changes at the centimeter scale with daily observations to capture the short-term dynamics of this rapidly evolving environment.

\textcolor{red}{Add figure of multi-temporal/multi-scale}

To investigate the long-term evolution of the glacier, this study uses archival aerial photogrammetry data collected by public agencies during mapping flights.
This technique allowed the reconstruction of past glacier morphology from 1977 to 2009, with 
approximately decadal intervals between models.  
The historical knowledge gained through this method is invaluable in documenting a natural
heritage that is rapidly disappearing due to climate change. 
Of particular interest, archival photogrammetry reveals a significant period of glacier expansion in the early of the glacier in the early 21st century, allowing precise quantification of the increase in ice volume and glacier thickness.

To understand the current evolution of the glacier, this work integrates low-cost UAVs and GNSS
for close-range photogrammetric monitoring.
Annual in-situ surveys, conducted since 2015, provide a periodical and highly accurate record of the evolution. 
Through these UAV surveys, centimeter-scale resolution enables detailed mapping of the dynamic environment, including precise quantification of glacier volume loss and study of variations in glacier flow rate.

However, alpine glacier dynamics are inherently non-linear, with a pronounced acceleration of processes in summer compared to winter.  
This trend has intensified in recent years due to the increasing frequency of hot and dry summers associated with climate change. 
While annual high-precision in-situ measurements provide essential insights into long-term geomorphological evolution, they lack the temporal resolution to fully capture the short-term kinematics of the glacier, which are crucial for
understanding the relationship between glacier dynamics and external drivers such as air temperature.
To address this need, a permanent monitoring system based on low-cost stereo cameras has been designed and installed on Belvedere Glacier. 
This system allows daily observations of glacier motion at a local spatial scale,
providing the high-frequency data needed for in-depth kinematic analysis.

This thesis describes the technical design and implementation of a low-cost glacier monitoring system, as well as the development of novel software tools for extracting relevant information from stereo camera images via photogrammetric processing. 
To overcome the limitations of existing software in handling images with extremely wide baselines, a new pipeline was designed and published. 
This pipeline allows the analysis of time-series point clouds and the extraction of metrics such as velocity, 
volume variations, and displacement.

A major challenge was related to the challenging mountain environment, which constrained the camera placement.
This resulted in extremely wide baselines and significant viewpoint differences.  
These conditions made it difficult to find corresponding points using traditional local feature-matching techniques 
and hindered 3D reconstruction using existing commercial and open-source photogrammetric software.
To overcome this obstacle, a novel pipeline was developed using state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms 
for robust feature matching that successfully overcomes the limitations of wide baseline stereo image processing.

This paper presents a successful pilot test of the low-cost glacier monitoring system.
The current uses only two cameras installed at the northwest terminal lobe of the Belvedere glacier, focused 
on the terminal ice cliff, which is the portion of the glacier that is experiencing the most severe retreat 
and fast evolution. 
To achieve a more comprehensive and robust monitoring framework capable of capturing the full dynamics of the glacier, 
the system needs to be scaled up. 
Expanding the camera network will increase the coverage and significantly improve the quality of the daily 3D 
reconstructions through greater data redundancy.
Motivated by this potential, the final part of this thesis focuses on the development of a flexible multi-view library. 
This library enables image matching using both state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and traditional hand-crafted features. 
Crucially, it integrates seamlessly with existing photogrammetric software for streamlined 3D reconstruction, 
thus supporting a future expansion of the monitoring system.

\section{The Belvedere Glacier}\label{sec:1:belvedereglacier}

The Belvedere Glacier (Randolph Glacier Inventory code RGI60--11.02858) is an alpine
glacier in Valle Anzasca (Italy), on the east side of the Monte Rosa Massif (N
\ang{45;58} E \ang{7;55}) (\figref{fig:1:studyarea}).
The lower part of the Belvedere Glacier is a temperate debris-covered glacier, that
covers an area of
\SI{\sim1.8}{\kilo\meter\squared} and extends from an altitude of \SI{\sim2250}{\masl} to
\SI{\sim1800}{\masl}.
This region is characterized by a gentle slope, and it is fed by icefalls and snow
avalanches coming from the Monte Rosa East Face \citep{Haeberli2002}. 
In its low-relief
sector, the Belvedere Glacier splits into two lobes, reaching \SI{\sim1800}{\masl}.
The northern lobe, in particular, ends with a prominent ice cliff, from which the River
Anza springs.

Similarly to Miage Glacier (Monte Bianco, Valle d’Aosta), the Belvedere Glacier is almost
completely covered by rocks and boulders with dimensions ranging from a few decimetres to
some meters, which makes it a \textit{black glaciers}.
Due to the global warming trend, the number of black glaciers along the Italian Alps is
rising~\citep{Diolaiuti2003}.
Up to the beginning of the century, the~debris cover helped to compensate the effect of
the increased temperature, establishing a negative feedback in the temperature-ablation
relationship~\citep{Roethlisberger1985,Diolaiuti2003}.
However, in recent years, the debris cover protection has not been sufficient to limit
the glacier~retreat.

\end{figure}

In the past, several hazardous events originated from the Belvedere Glacier, such as floods
and slope instability, threatened the nearby village of Macugnaga and the Zamboni Zappa
Hut, at 2070 m a.s.l. \citep{Kaab2004}.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the Belvedere Glacier was characterized by a
particular surge-type dynamics  \citep{Haeberli2002}.
During the late 1990s, the~surface speeds of the whole glacier were ranging between
\SIlist{30;45}{\meter\per\year}~\citep{Roethlisberger1985, Kaab2005}.
During 2000--2001 an accelerated flow in the Monte-Rosa Glacier produced a wave of
compression-decompression stresses and strains in the Belvedere Glacier.
Surface velocities soared: values up to \SI{200}{\meter\per\year} were observed
photogrammetrically during autumn 2001~\citep{Kaab2004}.
The ice thickness increased more than~\SI{20}{\meter} and the wave travelled downwards,
creating a depression area in the accumulation zone, that was filled by a super-glacial
lake, the~Lago Effimero~\citep{Haeberli2002, Mortara2009}.

During spring 2002, the large depression at the foot of the Monte Rosa east face, caused by the 
surge-type movement was temporarily filled by a lake with a volume of \SI{3e6}{\cubic\meter}, 
the socalled \textit{Lago Effimero} (\textit{short-lived lake}).
Recognizing the potential danger of an outburst flood, the Italian Civil Defense Department rapidly 
implemented emergency measures, including evacuating parts of Macugnaga village, installing automatic 
alarm systems and pumps, and initiating detailed scientific investigations. 
Reduced meltwater input in July 2002, combined with natural subglacial drainage, stabilized and subsequently 
lowered the lake level.
However, the lake reformed in the spring 2003 and it burst out in mid-June of that year without causing 
any significant damage \citep{Kaab2004}.
